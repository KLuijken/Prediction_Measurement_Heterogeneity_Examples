# Prediction_Measurement_Heterogeneity_Examples

# CICovsel

## Version 0.1.0
Code of the data analysis from the manuscript "Changing predictor measurement procedures affected the performance of prediction models in clinical examples" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2019.11.001).

## Run entire analysis at once
The R code in .rcode/analysis can be used to perform the analysis. The script in .rcode/exe runs the analysis and generates figures at once.

## Processing descriptives and analysis results
The R code in ./rcode/visualisation creates figures depicting the results of the analysis. The script produces .pdf files. The scripts uses the .rds files available in ./data/summarised. The output of the script is saved in .results/figures.

Attached packages:
rms [version]

When data are simulated:
MASS [version]
